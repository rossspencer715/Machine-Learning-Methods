# Homework 1

## Due: September 13, 2018, 11:59 PM EST

## Instructions

Your homework submission must cite any references used (including
articles, books, code, websites, and personal communications). All
solutions must be written in your own words, and you must program the
algorithms yourself. If you do work with others, you must list the
people you worked with. If you solve any problems by hand just digitize
that page and submit it (make sure the problem is labeled).

Your programs must be written in Python. **All code must be able to compile and
run for full credit.** Comment all code following proper coding
conventions. Remember, if we can’t read it, we can’t grade it! (For more
information on python coding standards, refer to: [Coding Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)).

You should submit your assignment via Github. Submit your solutions as a
PDF named "hw(hw #).pdf". For example, homework 1 should be submitted
as hw01.pdf. If the assignment requires coding, submit your working code as a
.py file with the same name.  

If you have any questions address them to:

-   Connor McCurley (TA) – cmccurley@ufl.edu

-   Xiaolei Guo (TA) – suninth@ufl.edu

-   Daniel Wells (TA) – dwells@ufl.edu

## Homework 1 Questions

Homework 1 questions are documented here: [Homework1 Questions](hw01_questions.pdf)

## Additional Notes

Template code named "hw01.py" has been provided to you for this assignment.  While this is a good place to start, there are many things missing from the code.  It is up to you to fill them in!  You are not limited to using just what is in the template.  Feel free to add any vizualizations/ metrics that will help you understand the underlying processes/ methods.

If you import any additional packages or add any vizualizations, **make sure to add them to the travis.yml file**.

Good luck!
